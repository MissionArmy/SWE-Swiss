Overview
SWE-Swiss is a multi-task system designed to boost issue resolution quality and speed. It blends multi-task fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to optimize for practical software engineering tasks. The core idea is to train a single model to understand, triage, summarize, propose fixes, and validate changes across diverse issue types. The RL loop nudges the model toward behaviors that are aligned with real-world developer workflows and project guidelines.

Why SWE-Swiss
- Realistic problem framing: The project mirrors daily software maintenance work. It handles bug reports, feature requests, and code changes with equal emphasis.
- Multi-task learning: A single model learns to perform several related tasks, sharing knowledge across domains. This improves generalization and reduces the need to switch models.
- Reinforcement learning for behavior shaping: The RL component rewards practical, safe, and helpful actions. This makes the system reliable for production use.
- Reproducibility and transparency: The project emphasizes clear experiment logs, deterministic runs, and accessible evaluation metrics.
- Community and collaboration: The design supports contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners. It aims to become a knowledge hub for issue resolution research.

How it works
SWE-Swiss operates in three main phases: data collection and preprocessing, multi-task fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with policy refinement. The pipeline accepts issue descriptions, code excerpts, test results, and related metadata. It then produces helpful outputs such as triage labels, proposed fixes, code diffs, and validation tests. The RL loop evaluates outputs against human feedback and automated correctness checks, adjusting the policy to maximize practical value.

Architecture and workflow
- Data ingest: The system ingests issues, commits, test results, and documentation. It normalizes data to a common schema and enriches it with metadata like project context, component tags, and risk levels.
- Feature extraction: A shared representation layer maps textual, code, and structural data into embeddings. This layer captures syntax, semantics, and project-specific conventions.
- Task heads: Separate heads handle different tasks:
  - Triage and labeling: prioritizes issues and assigns labels like bug, enhancement, or task.
  - Summary and intent extraction: produces concise issue summaries and a clear goal statement.
  - Patch proposal: generates diffs or patch snippets that propose changes.
  - Test generation: creates relevant tests that exercise the proposed changes.
  - Explanation and rationale: provides reasoning behind suggested actions.
- Multi-task fine-tuning: A unified training objective blends cross-entropy losses with alignment signals from human feedback. The model learns to balance precision, recall, and usefulness across tasks.
- RL refinement: The policy undergoes reinforcement learning, guided by a reward function that rewards practical usefulness, code quality, safety, and alignment with project guidelines. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is used to stabilize updates.
- Evaluation loop: A mix of automatic metrics and human-in-the-loop evaluation assesses model outputs. The loop emphasizes usefulness, correctness, and maintainability.

Tasks and evaluation
- Issue triage: The model assigns priority, category, and component. Evaluation focuses on accuracy, speed, and alignment with project workflows.
- Issue summarization: Short, informative summaries that capture the problem, context, and desired outcome. Metrics include ROUGE-like scores and human satisfaction.
- Patch proposal: Proposes code changes with diffs and rationale. Evaluation looks at patch correctness, risk, and readability.
- Test generation: Creates unit and integration tests that validate the proposed changes. Coverage and quality of tests are key metrics.
- Guidance and rationale: The model explains its decisions. The quality of explanations is judged by clarity, usefulness, and traceability.
- Safety and compliance: Outputs must respect licensing, security policies, and risk thresholds. Evaluation includes checks for sensitive data leakage and unsafe patterns.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: Python 3.9+, PyTorch, CUDA-capable GPU, and a Linux-like environment. A conda setup is recommended for dependency management.
- Installation steps:
  - Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MissionArmy/SWE-Swiss.git
  - Create the environment: conda env create -f environment.yml
  - Activate the environment: conda activate swe-swiss
  - Install additional tools as needed: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Quick run:
  - Prepare a small sample dataset covering a few issues and their context.
  - Run the multi-task fine-tuning script: python tools/train_multitask.py --config configs/sample.yaml
  - Start the RL loop with: python tools/train_rl.py --config configs/rl_sample.yaml
- Expected outputs:
  - A trained model checkpoint
  - Evaluation reports with task-specific metrics
  - A set of example outputs for triage, summaries, and patch proposals
- Baselines:
  - A baseline model using standard multi-task fine-tuning
  - A baseline without RL to illustrate the impact of policy shaping
  - A lightweight off-policy variant for quick iteration

Data and privacy
- Data sources: Synthetic data and curated open-source issue repositories are used for training. Real project data is handled with care and anonymization where needed.
- Privacy considerations: Personal data is minimized. If user data appears, it is redacted before training or evaluation. Access to sensitive data is controlled and logged.
- Licensing: Data licensing follows standard open-source terms. Always respect the licenses of contributed data and third-party datasets.
- Data processing: Data is transformed to a normalized schema. Feature extraction preserves essential context while removing unnecessary identifiers.

Model hub and assets
- Model zoo: SWE-Swiss hosts multiple model variants, including base, fine-tuned, and RL-enhanced versions. Each variant includes a detailed readme with task capabilities, expected inputs, and outputs.
- Data assets: Datasets used for training and evaluation are organized with clear provenance. Each dataset comes with a data card describing its scope, licensing, and quality indicators.
- Notion and research links: The project connects to a Notion workspace that documents experiments, guidelines, and design decisions. See the Notion badge at the top for quick access.

RL and fine-tuning details
- Fine-tuning strategy: The model is first trained on a broad set of related tasks using multi-task objectives. This creates a robust, generalizable core.
- RL specifics: The RL component uses a reward structure that favors practical usefulness, safety, and maintainability. The policy updates are stabilized with clipping and trust-region like constraints.
- Reward shaping: Rewards reflect qualitative signals such as clarity of explanation, usefulness of proposed changes, and alignment with project standards. Penalities apply to unsafe or brittle outputs.
- Evaluation in RL: The RL phase includes both offline and online evaluation. Offline evaluation uses held-out data, while online evaluation involves human-in-the-loop feedback on sample outputs.
- Reproducibility: Random seeds, dataset versions, and configuration files are recorded for every run. This makes it possible to reproduce results exactly.

Reproducibility and experiments
- Experiment scaffolding: Each experiment has a named configuration, a fixed seed, and a clear record of metrics. Results are stored in a structured directory with logs and artifacts.
- Versioning: The codebase uses semantic versioning for releases. Each release includes a changelog that describes major changes, new features, and breaking changes.
- Metrics dashboard: A central dashboard aggregates key metrics from all experiments. It tracks progress over time and highlights notable improvements.
- Visualization: Tools are provided to visualize attention maps, tokenization behavior, and decision logs. These visuals help diagnose errors and refine prompts.
- Repro steps: A minimal guide explains how to reproduce a given experiment. It covers how to set seeds, how to load data, and how to run the training loop.

Tests and quality checks
- Unit tests: Core components have unit tests that guard against regressions. Tests cover data loaders, model heads, and loss functions.
- Integration tests: End-to-end tests verify that the system completes a full cycle from data ingestion to output generation.
- Linting and style checks: Code style is enforced with linters and formatting tools. Consistency improves maintainability.
- Benchmarking: Baselines are run on standard benchmarks to quantify improvements. Reports include confidence intervals where applicable.
